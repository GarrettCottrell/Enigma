###**Functionality**

 3: Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented

###**Object Oriented Programming**

 4: Students have implemented either inheritance or at least one module in a logical manner.
    Students can speak as to how/why inheritance and modules made sense for the given implementations, why they improve the organization of the code, and the distinction between the two.

    --I used a module to contain specifically all the code for creating my shifts, which is then used by both my decipher and cipher classes

###**Ruby Conventions and Mechanics**

2.5/3: Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.

    --I think that I have a few methods that are too long and my formatting in general isn't great. I also think that there were a few areas where I could have used different enumerables and had shorter code as a result.
